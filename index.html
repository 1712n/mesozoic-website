						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<p>In our pursuit, we are redirecting the focus from traditional, opaque deep learning models, in which data is frozen at the learning stage, towards transparent, retrieval-augmented generation technologies, primarily employed for enhancing user-centric information retrieval and decision support systems.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<p>As major players in the industry often release proprietary models lacking in transparency and robust scientific validation, our team is committed to rigorously peer-reviewing our research and contributing to the advancement of open-source knowledge in the field of RAG. This commitment fosters a community-driven approach to AI development and ensures the ethical and responsible use of these powerful technologies.</p>

							<p>These models excel in their ability to synthesize information from diverse sources, making them incredibly effective for complex query answering and data integration tasks. Unlike traditional models, RAGs can dynamically pull in external data, allowing them to provide up-to-date, contextually relevant, and detailed responses. This feature is particularly beneficial in fields like healthcare, legal research, and technical support, where accuracy and the latest information are crucial. Moreover, RAG models enhance creative and academic endeavors by offering a broader range of perspectives and information, fostering innovation and comprehensive analysis. Their adaptability and precision in handling multifaceted information make RAG models a powerful tool in both professional and creative domains.</p>
